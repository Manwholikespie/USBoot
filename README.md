##A faster way to make bootable flash drives
First of all, let it be known that this script really only works on Mac OS X.
This is because it uses "diskutil" to modify the drive.  

Feel free to reuse this and make any changes you wish to it.
This is really just a personal script of mine that I occasionally use when I test out linux distros.
